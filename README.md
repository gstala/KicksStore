# KicksStore
This project is an online shoe store. I wrote it to learn Spring framework.
I used Spring Data, Spring Security, Spring MVC, Thymeleaf.

If you want to run this project, you must have MySql database with schema named "store".
You must also write your own username and password in application.properties file.
